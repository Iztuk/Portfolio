BANK APPLICATION
This is my first official project!

Introduction:
This application is a simple banking application that can save multiple users with unique usernames.
The possible functions of this application are checking user's account balance,
withdrawing, depositing, and checking the transaction history.

Personally, this was an annoying project to debug due to the multiple loops opening of files that broke the application.
Finally, I was able to do it make it work. I think this is a good start to my portfolio and can't wait to see what
the future holds!

(Feel free to break the application, please let me know what bugs you encounter!)


How to install the project:
This project should be fine by running it by itself as it has blocks of code that create the necessary files needed
for each user created.


How to use the project:
You can create users and check their account balance, deposit, withdraw, and check their transaction history.
The application is pretty simple and self-explanatory.
